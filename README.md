## 📊 Project Tasks  
1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**  
   - Handling missing values  
   - Standardizing formats (Duration, Genres, Ratings)  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Rating distribution of movies  
   - Votes vs. Ratings correlation  
   - Meta Score comparison with Ratings  
   - Genre-wise analysis  
   - Director & Cast contribution to high-rated movies  

3. **Visualization**  
   - Bar charts, Histograms, Pie charts, and Scatter plots  
   - Genre popularity distribution  
   - Top movies by ratings and votes  
   - Duration trends across years  

---

## 📌 Key Insights  
- High-rated movies often belong to **Drama, History, and Biography** genres  
- Directors like **Christopher Nolan & Martin Scorsese** have consistently high-rated movies  
- Longer duration movies (2h 30m+) often perform better critically  
- **Audience votes** strongly correlate with **movie popularity**
